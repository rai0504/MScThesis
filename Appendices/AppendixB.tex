In this section we cover Graph Theory and specifically Flow Networks, which is a branch of Graph Theory, which is fundamental to the understanding of image segmentation via graph cuts. With it roots in Germany where Euler tried to find the solution to the Konigsberg bridge problem, graph theory has since blossomed into a rich field of Mathematics with seemingly endless amounts of application. Graph Theory is a huge topic in mathematics and can be applied to many other sciences. Graph theory is part of another more encompassing field of Mathematics known as Combinatronics. Graph theory and applications are more useful than the average person would recognise. They're used in Google Maps to find shortest routes to destinations, in Molecular Chemistry to model the structure of atoms, and the list goes on for quite a while. It is no surprise that it is also found to be useful in image segmentation.

\begin{definition}[Graph]\label{def_graph}
	A graph $G$ is a pair $(V,E)$, where $V$ is the set of nodes/vertices and $E$ is the set of edges consisting of pairs $(u,v)$ where $u,v \in V$. The graph is assumed to be finite i.e. $|V| = n$ and $|E| = m$.
\end{definition}

In an \textbf{undirected graph}, the edge $(u,v)$ and $(v,u)$ are not distinct. That is, they refer to the same edge. However, in a \textbf{directed graph}, the two edge are now distinct. In a directed graph with edge $(u,v)$, $u$ is known as the \textbf{tail} and $v$ is know as the \textbf{head}. In directed graphs, edges, also known as arcs, are depicted by placing arrowheads at the head of the edge. Given an edge $e = (u,v)$, $u$ and $v$ are said to be \textbf{incident} on $e$. A graph is said to be \textbf{simple} if it does not contain any self-loops. A \textbf{self-loop} is an edge with of its end points being the same vertex.

\begin{definition}[Degree]
	The degree of a vertex $v$ is the number of edges incident on it. $deg(v) = |\{(u,v), (v,u) \in E\}|$. A self-loop counts for 2.
\end{definition}

If a graph is directed, also known as a \textbf{digraph}, then a node $v$ has an \textbf{in-degree} $d_{in}(v)$ and an \textbf{out-degree} $d_{out}(v)$. A digraph is said to be \textbf{balanced} if $d_{in}(v) = d_{out}(v), \forall v \in V$.

The \textbf{source node} only has out-going edges, $d_{in}(s) = 0$ and $d_{out}(s) \geq 0$. The \textbf{sink node} only has incoming edges, $d_{in} \geq 0$ and $d_out = 0$.

\begin{definition}[Flow]
	A flow $f : V^2 \longrightarrow \Re^{+}$ is associated with each edge $e = (u,v)$ such that:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item for each edge $e \in E$ we have $0 \leq f(e) \leq c(e)$. That is, the flow is positive and cannot excees the capacity of the edge.
		
		\item for each intermediate node $v \in V\setminus \{s,t\}$ the in- and out-flow of that node $\sum_{u \in V^-(v)} f(u,v) = \sum_{u \in V^+(v)} f(v,u)$.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

The \textbf{total flow} $F$ of a network is then what leave the source $s$ or reaches the sink $t$:
\begin{equation}
F(N) := \sum_{u \in V} f(s,u) - \sum_{u \in V}f(u,s) = \sum_{u \in V} f(u,t) - \sum_{u \in V}f(t,u)

	A cut of a network $N = (V,E)$ is a partitioning of the vertex set $V = P \bigcup \bar{P}$ into two disjoint sets $P$ containining the source node $s$ and $\bar{P}$ containing the sink node $t$. $P \bigcap \bar{P} = \emptyset$.

The \textbf{capacity} of a cut is the sum of the edges $(u,v) \in V$ where $u \in P$ and $v \in \bar{P}$:
\begin{equation}
\kappa (P, \bar{P}) = \sum_{u \in P; v \in \bar{P}} c(u,v)
\end{equation}

	The largest amount of flow that can be sent through the source that is able to reach the sink is known as the maximal flow.
