Fluorescence microscopy images of colonic healthy mucosa (n=35) and adenocarcinomas (n=35) were digitally captured and subjected to image texture analysis. Textural features derived from the grey level co-occurrence matrix were calculated. A modified version of the multiple discriminant analysis criterion was used to choose an appropriate subset of features. A minimum Mahalanobis distance, linear discriminant classifier and a simple evaluation `score' method were used to classify image feature data into the two categories. A subset of four textural features was selected and used for the description and classification of each image field. They were found appropriate to correctly classify 95{\%} of the images into the two classes, using two different classifiers. These features contained information about local homogeneity and grey level linear dependencies of the image. This study demonstrated that texture analysis techniques could provide valuable diagnostic decision support in a complex domain such as colorectal tissue.},

	abstract	= {This paper presents a method for improved automatic delineation of dendrites and spines from three-dimensional (3-D) images of neurons acquired by confocal or multi-photon fluorescence microscopy. The core advance presented here is a direct grayscale skeletonization algorithm that is constrained by a structural complexity penalty using the minimum description length (MDL) principle, and additional neuroanatomy-specific constraints. The 3-D skeleton is extracted directly from the grayscale image data, avoiding errors introduced by image binarization. The MDL method achieves a practical tradeoff between the complexity of the skeleton and its coverage of the fluorescence signal. Additional advances include the use of 3-D spline smoothing of dendrites to improve spine detection, and graph-theoretic algorithms to explore and extract the dendritic structure from the grayscale skeleton using an intensity-weighted minimum spanning tree (IW-MST) algorithm. This algorithm was evaluated on 30 datasets organized in 8 groups from multiple laboratories. Spines were detected with false negative rates less than 10{\%} on most datasets (the average is 7.1{\%}), and the average false positive rate was 11.8{\%}. The software is available in open source form.},

By combining the use of sodium fluorescein secretion into bile, with digitally enhanced fluorescence microscopy and time-lapse video, it was possible to capture and record the canalicular motility events that accompany the secretion of bile in life. Active bile canalicular contractions were found predominantly in zone 1 (periportal) hepatocytes of the liver. The contractile movements were repetitive, forceful, and appeared unidirectional moving bile in a direction towards the portal bile ducts. Contractions were not seen in the network of canaliculi on the surface of the liver. Cytochalasin B administration resulted in reduced canalicular motility, progressive dilation of zone 1 canaliculi, and impairment of bile flow. Canalicular dilations invariably involved the branch points of the canalicular network. The findings add substantively to previous in vitro studies using couplets, and suggest that canalicular contractions contribute physiologically to bile flow in the liver.},

	The patterns were described using a variety of numeric features,
	including Zernike moments, Haralick texture features, and a set of
	new features developed specifically for this purpose. To test the
	usefulness of these features, they were used to train a neural
	network classifier. The classifier was able to correctly recognize
	an average of 83% of previously unseen cells showing one of the ten
	patterns. The same classifier was then used to recognize previously
	unseen sets of homogeneously prepared cells with 98% accuracy.Availability: Algorithms were implemented using the commercial

Biotin-labeled DNA was hybridized to target chromosomes and subsequently rendered fluorescent by successive treatments with fluorescein-labeled avidin and biotinylated anti-avidin antibody. Human chromosomes in human-hamster hybrid cell lines were intensely and uniformly stained in metaphase spreads and interphase nuclei when human genomic DNA was used as a probe. Interspecies translocations were detected easily at metaphase. The human-specific fluorescence intensity from cell nuclei and chromosomes was proportional to the amount of target human DNA. Human Y chromosomes were fluorescently stained in metaphase and interphase nuclei by using a 0.8-kilobase DNA probe specific for the Y chromosome. Cells from males were 40 times brighter than those from females. Both Y chromosomal domains were visible in most interphase nuclei of XYY amniocytes. Human 28S ribosomal RNA genes on metaphase chromosomes were distinctly stained by using a 1.5-kilobase DNA probe.},

	abstract ={Intrinsic, three-dimensionally resolved, microscopic imaging of dynamical structures and biochemical processes in living preparations has been realized by nonlinear laser scanning fluorescence microscopy. The search for useful two-photon and three-photon excitation spectra, motivated by the emergence of nonlinear microscopy as a powerful biophysical instrument, has now discovered a virtual artist's palette of chemical indicators, fluorescent markers, and native biological fluorophores, including NADH, flavins, and green fluorescent proteins, that are applicable to living biological preparations. More than 25 two-photon excitation spectra of ultraviolet and visible absorbing molecules reveal useful cross sections, some conveniently blue-shifted, for near-infrared absorption. Measurements of three-photon fluorophore excitation spectra now define alternative windows at relatively benign wavelengths to excite deeper ultraviolet fluorophores. The inherent optical sectioning capability of nonlinear excitation provides three-dimensional resolution for imaging and avoids out-of-focus background and photodamage. Here, the measured nonlinear excitation spectra and their photophysical characteristics that empower nonlinear laser microscopy for biological imaging are described.},

	abstract 	= {Publisher Summary Quantitative imaging and image de-convolution have become standard techniques for the modern cell biologist because they can form the basis of an increasing number of assays for molecular function in a cellular context. There are two major types of de-convolution approaches—deblurring and restoration algorithms. Deblurring algorithms remove blur but treat a series of optical sections as individual two-dimensional entities and therefore sometimes mishandle blurred light. Restoration algorithms determine an object that, when convolved with the point-spread function of the microscope, could produce the image data. The advantages and disadvantages of these methods are discussed in this chapter. Image de-convolution in fluorescence microscopy has usually been applied to high-resolution imaging to improve contrast and thus detect small, dim objects that might otherwise be obscured. Their proper use demands some consideration of the imaging hardware, the acquisition process, fundamental aspects of photon detection, and image processing. This can prove daunting for some cell biologists, but the power of these techniques has been proven many times in the works cited in the chapter and elsewhere. Their usage is now well defined, so they can be incorporated into the capabilities of most laboratories.}

The spectroscopic nature and high-resolution imaging capabilities of light provide a means for probing biological morphology and function at the cellular and molecular levels. While the use of bioluminescent and fluorescent probes has become a mainstay in optical molecular imaging, a large number of other optical imaging modalities exist that can be included in this emerging field. In vivo imaging technologies such as optical coherence tomography and reflectance confocal microscopy have had limited use of molecular probes. In the last few years, novel nonfluorescent and nonbioluminescent molecular imaging probes have been developed that will initiate new directions in coherent optical molecular imaging. Classes of probes reviewed in this work include those that alter the local optical scattering or absorption properties of the tissue, those that modulate these local optical properties in a predictable manner, and those that are detected utilizing spectroscopic optical coherence tomography (OCT) principles. In addition to spectroscopic OCT, novel nonlinear interferometric imaging techniques have recently been developed to detect endogenous molecules. Probes and techniques designed for coherent molecular imaging are likely to improve the detection and diagnostic capabilities of OCT.},
